<h1>Hello, Geeks...!!</h1>
<p>

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for building software and solving problems. My primary experience is in languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, but I am always looking to learn and work with new technologies. I have experience with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular and Vue. Also, I have experience with back-end technologies like Node.js, Express and frameworks like Flask, Django. I am well versed with database technologies like MySQL, MongoDB, and GraphQL.

I have experience working on a variety of projects, from small personal projects to large enterprise applications. I am particularly interested in machine learning, data science, and web development.

On this profile, you will find a variety of my projects, including sample code and documentation. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
